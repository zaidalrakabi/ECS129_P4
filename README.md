ECS 129 Project 4; By: Munir Nur and Zaid Al Rakabi

kernel.cpp is a program to test how similar two protein sequences are using the BL62 matrix and kernel method for comparing sequences developed by Smale et al. and Najoomi and Koehl. For more information on how the algorithm works and the results we gathered read our paper: Comparing Protein Sequences using String Kernels.
